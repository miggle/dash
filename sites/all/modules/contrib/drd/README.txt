-- TROUBLESHOOTING --

In some really rare cases there might be an issue that a domain wouldn't properly
install, then it's very likely that this is caused by the settings.php file of that
domain and we suggest that you clear the respective file up and try again. Clearing
up means that you may want to remove all comments and commands that are not really
needed. What DRD is really interested in is to identify the $db_url for the database
connection of this domain.
